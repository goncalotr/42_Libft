# Libft - 42 C Library

This repository contains my implementation for the `libft` project, a fundamental part of the 42 cursus. It includes reimplementations of standard C library functions and additional helper functions.

## Build

To create the static library `libft.a`:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

To use this library in your other C projects:

Place the libft.a file and the libft.h header file where your project can access them.

Include the header in your source code: #include "libft.h"

Link the library during compilation:

```bash  
cc your_project_files.c libft.a -o your_executable
```

## Functions

A complete list of functions is available in the libft.h header file.
